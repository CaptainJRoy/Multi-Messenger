So we meet again...

This is a simple android app that allows you to send multiple messages to a destination.
It's basically spam, but i had nothing better to do so i gave it a shot.

NOTE: It will send messages from your service provider, please make sure you don't have any fees associated with messaging.
Feel free to share it with whomever you please.
If you feel that somenthings could be improved, let me know.

Have a great day!
